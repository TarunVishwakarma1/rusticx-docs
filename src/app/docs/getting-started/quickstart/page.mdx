---

import { Tabs, Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components'

# Quick Start

Add Rusticx to your rust project.

Rusticx supports multiple databases like:
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- MySQL

<Callout type='info'>Use postgres for now as it is fully tested.</Callout>

## Installation

Add rusticx in your Cargo.toml file

### Using cargo cli
<Tabs items={['cargo']} defaultIndex={1}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```sh frame=none
  cargo add rusticx rusticx_derive --features rusticx/postgres
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Manual Installation

Add this line in Cargo.toml

```toml filename="Cargo.toml"
rusticx = { version = '0.1.3', features = ['postgres']}
rusticx_derive = { version = '0.1.2' }
```

<Callout type='info'>check rusticx crate in https://crates.io/ for the latest version.</Callout>

Rusticx also needs ```serde``` crate to serialize and deserialize the struct.
So it's a good idea to add serde in your project if you haven't.



And thats it your done! ðŸŽ‰ Rusticx is added in your project.
