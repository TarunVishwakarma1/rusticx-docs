# Usage

After you have added rusticx in your rust project. Its now time to use the library.

## Example

<Steps>

#### main.rs
In your main.rs create a struct

```rust filename="main.rs"

struct Users{
    id: Option<i32>, // an Option<i32> field is required
    name: String,
    email: String,
    //add more fields as required
}
```

#### Add dependencies for Rusticx

```rust filename="main.rs"
use rusticx_derive::Model;
use chrono::NaiveDateTime;
use uuid::Uuid

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Model)]
struct Users{
    id: Option<i32>, // an Option<i32> field is required
    name: String,
    email: String,
    created_at: NaiveDateTime,
    uuid: Uuid
    //add more fields as required
}
```

#### Configure the struct

```rust filename="main.rs"
use rusticx_derive::Model;
use chrono::NaiveDateTime;
use uuid::Uuid

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Model)]
#[model(table = "employee")] // this will create the table as employee.
struct Users{
    #[model(primary_key,auto_increment)] // this will make the id field in the database as primary key which will auto increment REQUIRED
    id: Option<i32>, // an Option<i32> field is REQUIRED
    #[model(column = "full_name")]  // you can rename your fields in the database by using this
    #[serde(rename = "full_name")]
    name: String,
    email: String,
    created_at: NaiveDateTime, 
    #[model(uuid)] // this can generate an auto generated uuid in your table
    uuid: Uuid
    //add more fields as required
}
```

And that's it, you have now configured your struct to use the rusticx_derive macro model.
